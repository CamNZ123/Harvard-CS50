0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

    The longest word is the large dictionary used as the limit.

1. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

    Gives the user info about the execution of the program. In this program it gives the user the time taken.

2. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

    16.

3. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

    C requires passing structs by reference in functions. If you did it by value, the size would be too large.

4. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

    For each letter in the file it will go through and check if it is in the dictionary.
    
    If is the letter is a letter or a apostrophe, it gets added to the word.
    If is has a number, it is ignored.
    If is is bigger then the word limit, it is ignored.
    
    If the word isn't ignored it is checked for spelling.
        
5. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

    To check for invalid digits (numbers and ?!@#$$%^&*()[]{};:)

6. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

    Becuase word LENGTH and DICTIONARY are contants
